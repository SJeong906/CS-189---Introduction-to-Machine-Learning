# CS 189 - Introduction to Machine Learning

## 1. Course Description
> Machine learning is at the core of modern artificial intelligence, transforming how we approach problems in vision, language, robotics, recommendation systems, and countless other areas. This course introduces the theoretical foundations, algorithms, and applications of machine learning, combining mathematical rigor with practical experience.
>
> Throughout the semester, we will explore the full pipeline of machine learning from problem formulation and working with data, to designing models and optimizing them. We will begin with a discussion of what machine learning is, how problems are framed and categorized, and the taxonomy of common learning paradigms. We will review the mathematical background necessary for the course, including probability and optimization concepts.
>
> We will then study unsupervised learning methods, including clustering with k-means and Expectation–Maximization, and dimensionality reduction with Principal Components Analysis (PCA). We will discuss regression in detail, starting with objective functions and then moving to linear regression and its Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) interpretation, and then exploring how regression connects to classification.
>
> The deep learning portion of the course will begin with neural network fundamentals, including building non-linear models, choosing architectures and activation functions, and defining loss functions. We will cover PyTorch implementations, backpropagation, batch normalization, initialization strategies, and regularization. We will then survey other deep architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and transformers — along with generative models such as Large Language Models (LLMs), autoencoders, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
>
> Finally, the course will include guest lectures from leading researchers, discussions of emerging topics in the field, and opportunities to connect theoretical concepts to cutting-edge research and applications.
